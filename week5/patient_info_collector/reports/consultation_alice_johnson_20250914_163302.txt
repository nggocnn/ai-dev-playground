CONSULTATION SUMMARY:
Hello Alice Johnson! Thank you for sharing your symptoms. Based on the information you provided—sore throat, mild fever, and fatigue—here are some preliminary health advice and insights:

### Possible Causes
1. **Common Cold**: This is a viral infection that often presents with symptoms like sore throat, mild fever, fatigue, runny/stuffy nose, and mild cough. 
2. **Gastroenteritis**: Though more related to digestive symptoms, it can cause mild fever and fatigue if accompanied by nausea or diarrhea.
3. **Chronic Fatigue**: This involves persistent tiredness that doesn't improve with rest, but in your case, it could be related to the current symptoms and might not be a standalone issue.

### Recommended Actions
- **Rest**: Ensure you get plenty of sleep to help your body recover.
- **Hydration**: Drink lots of fluids such as water, herbal teas, and clear broths.
- **Soothing the Throat**: Gargle with warm salt water to relieve sore throat discomfort. Throat lozenges can also help.
- **Manage Fever and Pain**: Consider over-the-counter medications like acetaminophen or ibuprofen to manage fever and body aches.
- **Steam Inhalation**: Using a humidifier or inhaling steam from a hot shower may help ease congestion if you experience it.

### When to Seek Medical Attention
- If your symptoms last more than 10 days.
- Fever rises above 101.3°F (38.5°C).
- You experience severe headache, sinus pain, difficulty breathing, or a persistent cough with thick, colored mucus.
- Fatigue persists for more than two weeks or interferes significantly with daily activities.
