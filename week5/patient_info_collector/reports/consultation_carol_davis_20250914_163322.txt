CONSULTATION SUMMARY:
Hello Carol Davis,

Thank you for sharing your symptoms and medical history with me. Based on the information you've provided, here are some preliminary health advice and insights regarding your current symptoms of severe headache, dizziness, and nausea, particularly in the context of your history of migraines:

### Understanding Your Symptoms
1. **Migraine**: Given your history of migraines, the symptoms you are experiencing could be related to a migraine episode. Migraines can cause intense, throbbing pain (often on one side of the head), accompanied by nausea, dizziness, and sensitivity to light or sound.

2. **Other Conditions**: It's also important to consider that severe headaches can result from tension headaches or even other underlying conditions. Symptoms like dizziness and nausea can be associated with migraines, tension headaches, or even digestive issues such as indigestion.

### Immediate Recommendations
- **Rest**: Find a quiet, dark room and try to lie down. This can help alleviate migraine symptoms.
- **Hydration**: Drink plenty of water. Dehydration can worsen headaches and dizziness.
- **Cold Compress**: Applying a cold compress or ice pack to your forehead may provide relief from the headache.
- **Avoid Triggers**: If you know certain foods, smells, or activities trigger your migraines, try to avoid them.

### When to Seek Immediate Medical Attention
You should seek medical care if you experience:
- A headache that is the worst you've ever had.
- Symptoms that are accompanied by confusion, fainting, or severe nausea that prevents you from keeping food down.
- Headache with fever, stiff neck, or vision changes.
- Any new or unusual headache patterns.

Take care, and I hope you feel better soon!
