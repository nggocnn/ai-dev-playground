CONSULTATION SUMMARY:
Hello David Wilson,

Thank you for sharing your symptoms with me. Based on the information you've provided—stomach pain, loss of appetite, and feeling tired—there are a few potential conditions that could be causing these issues:

1. **Indigestion (Dyspepsia)**: This is a feeling of discomfort in the upper abdomen that can arise from overeating, consuming spicy or fatty foods, or eating too quickly. Symptoms may include bloating, nausea, and discomfort after meals. Recommendations include:
   - Eat smaller, more frequent meals.
   - Avoid spicy, fatty, or acidic foods.
   - Stay upright for a few hours after eating.
   - Consider over-the-counter antacids for relief.

2. **Gastroenteritis (Stomach Flu)**: This is often caused by viral or bacterial infections and might present with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps. Management includes:
   - Staying hydrated with clear fluids.
   - Resting and avoiding solid foods initially.
   - Gradually reintroducing bland foods like bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast (BRAT diet).

3. **Acid Reflux/GERD**: This occurs when stomach acid backs up into the esophagus, leading to discomfort. Symptoms include heartburn and regurgitation. Treatment recommendations include:
   - Avoiding trigger foods and eating smaller meals.
   - Not lying down immediately after eating.
   - Elevating the head of your bed during sleep.

### When to Seek Medical Attention:
- If you experience severe abdominal pain.
- If there is persistent vomiting or blood in your vomit or stool.
- If you experience unexplained weight loss or difficulty swallowing.
- If symptoms last more than a few days or worsen.

I also found a helpful article that discusses various causes of abdominal pain and loss of appetite, which may provide additional insights: [Healthline - What's Causing My Abdominal Pain and Loss of Appetite?](https://www.healthline.com/health/abdominal-pain-and-appetite-loss).

Please remember that this advice is preliminary, and it's important to consult a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation, especially if your symptoms persist or worsen. Take care, and feel free to reach out if you have further questions!
