**Key Points:**
- Customers report slow search results, particularly during peak hours (7 PM - 9 PM).
- Unindexed queries are taking up to 5 seconds to complete.
- Suggestions include adding indexes on "category" and "price_range" fields and partitioning the products table.
- Implementation of skeleton loaders for immediate feedback during loading.
- A caching experiment for search results will be conducted for 2 weeks alongside indexing.

**Decisions:**
- Implement a 2-week trial for caching search results while adding indexes.

**Action Items:**
- **Analytics**: Track average search time, conversion rate, and user retention before and after caching (Owner not specified, due date not mentioned).
- **Ops**: Monitor database CPU and memory load during the test (Owner not specified, due date not mentioned).
- **QA**: Create test cases for caching and indexing scenarios; coordinate with BE and DB teams (Owner not specified, due date not mentioned).
- **Marketing**: Prepare a campaign to promote "faster search" if performance improves significantly (Owner not specified, due date not mentioned).
- **Search Team**: Consider query result pre-computation for top 100 search terms (Owner not specified, due date not mentioned).
