**Key Points:**
- Sprint 15 planning focuses on completing the payment feature and improving page load speed.
- Backend has completed the payment and login APIs; payment API is unit tested, login API awaiting QA confirmation.
- Frontend has a display error on the product page, especially for products without images, with a fix planned before noon.
- DevOps has configured CI/CD for the staging environment and needs access from Minh to test deployment; updated pipeline for automated testing after each deployment.
- Test cases for the login API are completed and will be tested in the morning.

**Decisions:**
- The addition of lazy-loading for images will be postponed to Sprint 16 to avoid impacting the current deadline.

**Action Items:**
- **Minh:** Provide access to DevOps for testing deployment (due date not specified).
- **Minh:** Merge the login API into the main branch after QA approval (due date not specified).
- **All team members:** Update task progress on Jira by 5 PM today.
