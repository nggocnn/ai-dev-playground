**Key Points:**
- Migration from monolithic architecture to microservices is being considered, starting with the user service.
- User service has minimal dependencies, making it a suitable candidate for the pilot.
- Centralized JWT token validation is essential to maintain security.
- Kubernetes namespaces and CI/CD pipelines will be prepared for the new service, with ArgoCD proposed for deployment management.
- A new set of test plans will be developed for service-to-service calls, focusing on authentication and error handling.
- Relevant user tables need to be replicated to the new service’s database without downtime.
- Consideration for introducing an API gateway layer for routing between services.
- Decision needed on service discovery approach (Consul vs. native K8s service registry).
- A cost estimate for the new infrastructure will be conducted.

**Decisions:**
- Approve pilot migration of the user service starting next sprint.
- Milestone 1: basic service extraction to be completed in 2 weeks.
