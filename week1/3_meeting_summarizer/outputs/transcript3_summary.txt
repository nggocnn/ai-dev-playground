**Key Points:**
- Outage occurred from 13:05 to 13:47 due to an expired TLS certificate on the main API gateway.
- The certificate auto-renewal cronjob failed silently two months prior, and there were no alerts for certificate expiry.
- 100% of users were impacted during the downtime, with increased server load from multiple retry attempts by customers.
- Communication to customers was sent within 30 minutes of detection, but feedback suggests a need for faster updates.

**Decisions:**
- Implement automatic certificate renewal using Let's Encrypt with proper failure alerts in PagerDuty.

**Action Items:**
- **Dev:** Add certificate expiry checks in Grafana dashboards. (Owner not specified; due date not mentioned)

- **QA:** Write a test to hit the API over HTTPS and verify a valid certificate is in place. (Owner not specified; due date not mentioned)
- **Security:** Add a 30-day expiry alert and a 7-day urgent alert for certificates. (Owner not specified; due date not mentioned)
- **Comms:** Prepare a pre-approved incident template for quicker public posting. (Owner not specified; due date not mentioned)
