**Key Points:**
- Focus on addressing complaints about slow mobile app performance on 3G connections.
- Image assets in product listings are currently too large (up to 2MB); plan to compress to under 300KB using WebP format.
- Redis caching has been implemented, reducing API latency by 25%.

**Decisions:**
- Release the performance update to 20% of users on Friday and monitor metrics for one week before a full rollout.
